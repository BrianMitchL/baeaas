# BAEaaS
BAE as a Service

## Installation

### Content-Types

To use different content types (which can be found in the [server/renderers](https://github.com/BrianMitchL/baeaas/tree/master/server/renderers) directory), use the "Accept" header in your request. Eg. "Accept: application/json"

BAEaaS currently accepts:
 * application/json
 * text/plain
 * text/html

## Attribution
